How to use:
 - Place custom modules on your ship like any other modules
 - Custom modules are not exported to base-64 nor to the ".dat" file
 - However, when you "Save as", you will get the list of your custom modules,
    as well as the center point of the command module.
 - Also you will get a "zz_adder_[ModuleName].prpl" script in the same folder,
    which serves as the "Master.prpl" script from planetfall's custom module solution
 - Also you will get a "zz_robot_[ModuleName].prpl" script in the same folder,
    which you can use to add the modules on NPC ships
 - Custom modules are loaded correctly when you "Load from" a file
 - Unknown modules are displayed as a 1x1 question mark (when loading from a file)

To add your own custom module:
 - create a new file in the "customModules" directory with a ".txt" extension
 - look at example modules to see how to set name, size and image name
 - build cost and script name are optinal, they are used when creating the adder script
 - lastly, place your texture file in the "img/customModules" directory
 - you need to restart the program to see changes
