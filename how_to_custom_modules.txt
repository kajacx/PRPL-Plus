How to use:
 - Place custom modules on your ship like any other modules
 - Custom modules are not exported to base-64 nor to the ".dat" file
 - However, when you "Save as", you will get the list of your custom modules,
    as well as the center point of the command module.
 - This is exactly what you need if you are using planetfall's custom module script
 - Custom modules are loaded correctly when you "Load from" a file
 - Unknown modules are displayed as a 1x1 question mark (when loading from a file)

To add your own custom module:
 - create a new file in the "customModules" directory with a ".txt" extension
 - first line is the name of your modules
 - second line is width, third line is height
 - fourth line is the name of your texture file
 - lastly, place your texture file in the "img/customModules" directory
 - you need to restart the program to see changes
